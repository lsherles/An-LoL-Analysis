## Introduction

In competitive League of Legends, the part of the game that is make or break is the draft. This is where each team selects and bans 5 champions, going in a snake order. The goal is to pick champions that are strong and synergize well with each other, while also banning champions that are strong against your own.
This project focuses on the the tier 1 leagues (LCK, LEC, LCS, LPL), which are the highest level of League of Legends anywhere around the world, and explores how the draft phase affects the outcome of each game. 
In the first few parts of this project, we will look at at the most picked and banned champions, and how they affect the win rate of the teams that pick or ban them.
